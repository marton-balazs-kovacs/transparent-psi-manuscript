This repository contains the data collected for the [Transparent Psi
Project](https://osf.io/jk2zf/). This README contains the results
calculated from the currently available data. The document was last

Result not yet final\! Data presented on this page represent the current
trend calculated from the data. The results should not be
over-interpreted\! Random variations may cause the data to cross the
decision thresholds. Statistical decisions will only be drawn at the
pre-specified stopping points. The next stopping point will be at
reaching 37836 trials.

# Summary of the results

The study currently has 33285 erotic trials gathered from a total of
1860 participants. There has been 25 incomplete study sessions so far
resulting in a total of 195 (0.59%) missing data points due to
incomplete sessions. We observed a total of 49.92% successful guesses
within 33285 erotic trials (posterior mode = 50.06%, posterior 90% HDI =
49.61%, 50.49%).
